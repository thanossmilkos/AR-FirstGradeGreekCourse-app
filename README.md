# Description
The aim of this project is to design and develop an augmented reality application for the assessment 
of the Modern Greek language course of the 1st grade. The app not only offers a variety of 
educational exercises that simulate the already existing exercises, contained in the textbook, but also 
adapts them into fun and engaging mini video games. All the types of exercises, including the words 
that were used, are based on the latest textbook edition, taught in the first year of Greek elementary 
school.

                                                        1st Game of the app


The application was created using the Unity Game Engine and the programming language C#. In 
addition, another important tool was the Vuforia Engine which was necessary in order to scan the 
pages for each exercise. One thing to be noted is that it is required to use a mobile phone or tablet to 
run the app properly.

In total, the app consists of 6 mini games which are divided into three sections with two games each. 
The games are arranged in such a way that they reflect a level of difficulty, with each game being 
more difficult than the previous one.
